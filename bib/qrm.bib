                   for millennia to come there will be caves in which
                   his shadow will be shown'Friedrich Nietzsche
                   described The Joyous Science as a book of
                   'exuberance, restlessness, contrariety and April
                   showers'. A deeply personal and affirmative work, it
                   straddles his middle and late periods and contains
                   some of the most important ideas he would ever
                   express in writing. Moving from a critique of
                   conventional morality, the arts and modernity to an
                   exhilarating doctrine of self-emancipation, this
                   playful combination of aphorisms, poetry and prose is
                   a treasure trove of philosophical insights, brought

                   God's Spirit, intercession becomes an adventure. We
                   have never been so aware of the need to contend for
                   our cities against a rising tide of spiritual evil.
                   As a result, multitudes of Christians worldwide have
                   begun to prayerwalk their cities and nations.
                   Prayerwalking gives you a practical menu of proven
                   ideas to begin preparing whole cities for spiritual
                   awakening. Biblical insights will build your faith to

  abstract =      {The companion book to Beyond Good and Evil, the three
                   essays included here offer vital insights into
                   Nietzsche's theories of morality and human
                   psychology.Nietzsche claimed that the purpose of The
                   Genealogy of Morals was to call attention to his
                   previous writings. But in fact the book does much
                   more than that, elucidating and expanding on the
                   cryptic aphorisms of Beyond Good and Evil and
                   signalling a return to the essay form. In these three
                   essays, Nietzsche considers the development of ideas
                   of 'good' and 'evil'; explores notions of guilt and
                   bad consience; and discusses ascetic ideals and the
                   purpose of the philosopher. Together, they form a
                   coherent and complex discussion of morality in a work
                   that is more accessible than some of Nietzsche's
                   previous writings.Friedrich Nietzsche was born near
                   Leipzig in 1844. When he was only twenty-four he was
                   appointed to the chair of classical philology at
                   Basel University. From 1880, however, he divorced
                   himself from everyday life and lived mainly abroad.
                   Works published in the 1880s include The Gay Science,
                   Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, On the
                   Genealogy of Morals, Twilight of the Idols and The
                   Antichrist. In January 1889, Nietzsche collapsed on a
                   street in Turin and was subsequently
                   institutionalized, spending the rest of his life in a
                   condition of mental and physical paralysis. Works
                   published after his death in 1900 include Will to
                   Power, based on his notebooks, and Ecce Homo, his
                   autobiography.Michael A. Scarpitti is an independent
                   scholar of philosophy whose principal interests
                   include English and German thought of the eighteenth
                   and nineteenth centuries, as well as exegesis and
                   translation theory.Robert C. Holub is currently Ohio

                   in this post-millennial meditation on the vexed
                   relationship between psyche and place in a globalised
                   world, bringing together for the first time the very
                   best of their 'Psychogeography' columns for the
                   Independent. The introduction, 'Walking to New York',
                   is both a prelude to the verbal and visual essays
                   that make up this extraordinary collaboration, and a
                   revealing exploration of the split in Self's
                   Jewish-American-British psyche and its relationship
                   to the political geography of the post-9/11 world.
                   Ranging from the Scottish Highlands to Istanbul and

                   INTERVENTIONS IN SPACES OF HERITAGE-TOURISM by PHIL
                   SMITH This thesis offers new models for participatory
                   and performative interventions in sites of heritage
                   tourism through a theorized practical engagement.
                   Drawing on both Tourism Studies and Performance
                   Studies, the primary aim of these interventions is to
                   reveal and provoke ways of seeing and using these
                   sites as places of multiple meanings rather than as
                   ones constricted and bounded by normative heritage
                   narratives in their production and management. The
                   experimental phase of the project discussed in the
                   thesis includes three contrasting case studies:
                   GeoQuest, Sardine Street, and Water Walk. These are
                   each analysed and evaluated through my development of
                   a `mythogeographic' framework that includes the
                   performative techniques of layering, rhizomatic
                   interweaving, the making of 'anywheres' and the
                   self-mythologising of the activist. The thesis charts
                   a trajectory through praxis, from developing models
                   for ambulatory, signage-based and `mis-guided'
                   interventions to be undertaken by performance
                   `specialists', towards a dispersal of their tactics
                   for use by heritage tourists in general. It thus
                   describes a related change in the balance of the
                   research methodology from ethnographic participant
                   observation towards practice-as-research (PaR), the
                   latter of which both generated and enacted knowledge
                   and understanding. This PaR took the form of various
                   visits and forays to and across heritage sites and
                   landscape, and also the production of a `toolkit' of
                   handbook, pocketbook, website and online short films
                   for the dispersal of tactics and a strategy that is
                   eventually called `counter-tourism'. The thesis thus
                   includes the publications A Sardine Street box of
                   tricks, Counter-tourism: the handbook,
                   Counter-tourism: a pocketbook and the DVD, Tactics
                   for counter-tourism, as well as their fully theorized
                   critical contextualisation. These represent a PaR
                   enquiry that attempts to creatively express my
                   research findings from productions made in the field
                   through a popular form of writing and presentation
                   that is capable of inspiring general,
                   `non-specialist' tourists to make their own
                   performance interventions in heritage sites.},

                   comprehensively prevent the threat of spiritual harm
                   for my research assistants in Ghana and Cameroon. In
                   this work, I discuss spiritual care as a major
                   lacunae of research methodology considerations and
                   ethics procedures in relation to my own work in the
                   field of political science. Through an analysis of my
                   methods and ethics preparations and subsequent
                   fieldwork, I hope to demonstrate how epistemological
                   and structural biases I enacted are also embedded in
                   academic processes and how these helped facilitate
                   this oversight. I argue that a modernist approach to
                   research and ethics can lead researchers, such as
                   myself, to overlook important considerations
                   regarding spiritual care.},

                   of materialism and its relevance to contemporary
                   science and culture In this eye-opening,
                   intellectually stimulating appreciation of a
                   fascinating school of philosophy, Terry Eagleton
                   makes a powerful argument that materialism is at the
                   center of today's important scientific and cultural
                   as well as philosophical debates. The author reveals
                   entirely fresh ways of considering the values and
                   beliefs of three very different materialists--Marx,
                   Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein--drawing striking
                   comparisons between their philosophies while
                   reflecting on a wide array of topics, from ideology
                   and history to language, ethics, and the aesthetic.
                   Cogently demonstrating how it is our bodies and
                   corporeal activity that make thought and
                   consciousness possible, Eagleton's book is a valuable
                   exposition on philosophic thought that strikes to the
                   heart of how we think about ourselves and live in the

                   it is the everyday places around us - the cities we
                   live in - that need to be rediscovered. What does it
                   feel like to find the city's edge, to explore its

                   reclaims the city, recasting it as a place for
                   endless adventures. Plotting expeditions from London,
                   Paris, Berlin, Detroit, Chicago, Las Vegas and Los
                   Angeles, Bradley L. Garrett has evaded urban security
                   in order to experience the city in ways beyond the

                   'place hacking': the recoding of closed, secret,
                   hidden and forgotten urban spaces into realms of
                   opportunity. Explore Everything is an account of his
                   escapades with the London Consolidation Crew, an
                   urban exploration collective, as well as an urbanist
                   manifesto on rights to the city that inspires new

                   Slavoj ?i?ek's argument in this pathbreaking and
                   eclectic new work. Recent history has seen
                   developments such as quantum physics and Freudian
                   psychoanalysis, not to speak of the failure of
                   twentieth-century communism, shake our understanding
                   of existence.In the process, the dominant tradition
                   in Western philosophy lost its moorings. To bring

                   committed materialist and communist \textendash{}
                   proposes a radical revision of our intellectual

                   of the basis and possibilities of contemporary

                   transcendental approach without regressing to
                   na{\"i}ve, pre-Kantian realism, ?i?ek offers a series

                   GraylingNietzsche was one of the most revolutionary
                   thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke
                   Zarathustra remains his most influential work. It

                   the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the

                   blazing intensity, Nietzsche argues that the meaning

                   or meek submission, but in an all-powerful life

                   between qualitative and quantitative approaches (and
                   related dichotomies) may be less than useful, such
                   divisions remain entrenched in the core social
                   science disciplines. Theoretical and methodological
                   attempts to move out of and beyond dichotomous frames
                   of reference have not yet led to reconstruction of
                   the social science enterprise. Application of Goody's
                   analysis of the impact of literacy on human cognition
                   to this question suggests that the mode (as well as
                   the context) of academic discourse has structured and
                   constrained the way we (can) think about what we do.
                   The paper concludes by briefly reflecting on the
                   potential of triangulation for reconstructing the way
                   we think about methodological and theoretical
                   dichotomies.},

  abstract =      {Since the early 2000s there has been an increase in
                   artists who are walking as an essential part of their
                   artistic practice. This book identifies the unique
                   attributes of walking to develop a definition for
                   walking as an artistic medium. Drawing on historical
                   sources, such as the walks of the Romantic poets,
                   Dadaists and Letterist/Situationist Internationals,
                   it presents a practice based approach to walking
                   focused on the radical memory of the medium. The book
                   covers three contemporary organisations working to
                   develop the artistic medium of
                   walking\textemdash{}London's Walking Artists Network,
                   Scotland's Walking Institute and New York City's Walk

                   organisation's strategies contribute to the
                   development of the artistic medium of walking. The
                   book is framed by five walking exercises, and invites
                   the reader to create a memory palace for the medium
                   of walking as a practical exploration of artistic
                   walking practices.},
