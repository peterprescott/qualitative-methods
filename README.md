# README

In this repo you should find my two assignments done for the ENVS441 module
*Qualitative Research Methods*, done as part of my [Data Analysis
MSc](https://github.com/peterprescott/data-analysis-msc) at the University of Liverpool.

The first was a [presentation](pdf/presentation.pdf) discussing a
published paper using a qualitative research method.

The second was an [essay](pdf/essay_two_column.pdf) describing and
critiquing a qualitative research method. (To convert the [Markdown text file](md/essay.md) 
to PDF, I use a reproducible setup of Pandoc, Latex, and Docker, which you can find
[here](https://github.com/peterprescott/publisher).)
