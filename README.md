# README

In this repo you should find my essay for the ENVS441 module
*Qualitative Research Methods*, done as part of my [Data Analysis
MSc](https://github.com/peterprescott/data-analysis-msc) at the University of Liverpool.

To convert the Markdown text file to PDF, I use a reproducible setup of
Pandoc, Latex, and Docker, which you can find
[here](https://github.com/peterprescott/publisher).
